# Gold Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This project implements a time series analysis and prediction model for gold prices using historical data from 1950 onwards. The objective of the project is to forecast future gold prices based on past trends and evaluate the model's performance using statistical metrics.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and transformation for time series forecasting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various statistical and visual analyses of historical gold prices.
- **Time Series Modeling**: Prediction of future gold prices using Linear Regression and time series techniques.
- **Evaluation**: Performance evaluation of the prediction model using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`
- `scikit-learn`
